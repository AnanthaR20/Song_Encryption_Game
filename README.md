# Song_Encryption_Game
This is a small python game I made which is a song-ified version of a cryptographic indistinguishability experiment. Instead of encrypting esoteric plaintext, the idea is to encrypt melodies.

The "sound_fonts/" folder contains a .sf2 file which contains the sound font necessary to run the code. This sound font can be found at this URL: https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/index.html

To play the game just run 'song_encryption_game.py'
