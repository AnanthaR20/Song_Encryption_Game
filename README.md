# Song_Encryption_Game
This is a small python game I developed which is a song-ified version of a cryptographic indistinguishability experiment. Instead of encrypting esoteric plaintext, I had the idea to encrypt melodies.

The "sound_fonts/" folder will be empty. This is because .sf2 files can be too large to push to a remote repo. To ensure the game runs properly, download the FluidR3_GM.sf2 sound font file from this URL: https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/index.html

After that put that .sf2 file in the "sound_fonts/" directory. It should run properly.
